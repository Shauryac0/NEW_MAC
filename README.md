# NEW_MAC
It is my first project, due to that I have made it simple.
This only took me more tha 5 days cause I recreated it 3 times.
The main purpose my macropad is to contro VLC:
 - Play/Pause
 - Volume Up
 - Volume Down
 - Mute

(though I am thinking to wire the switches from RP2040 cause adding the switches is little difficult cause they are above the main PCB.
